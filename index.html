              <div class="text">
                  <p>Many of the barriers minority and immigrant family face when they are renting an apartment are the result of invisible force of unconscious bias and stereotypes. The language barriers also intensify the misunderstanding of each other. </p>
                  <p>This app is to break down those barriers and let people interact with their neighbors freely and more openly, to create a respectful digital space that supports people from different background to understand each other; to build a stronger community that minimizes crimes and raises neighborhood awareness and work together to create a better environment to live in.</p>
<p>Multiple languages support will be available through live-time translation in the app. The website Iâ€™m working on is to introduce and promote the app, it will demonstrate the features of the app and how to make neighborhood communities livable and strong.</p>
